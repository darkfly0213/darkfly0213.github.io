# Inugami School District Fiasco
## A recent data breach of Inugami School District revealed that students in five out of the six schools really seem to love the Persona Franchise. The school district has hired your security consulting company, Funside Hacking to examine why specific students and faculty were able to be breached. During the Investigation, Funside Hacking has identified three students and two faculty whose weak passwords have unknowingly allowed attackers to breach into the grander school internet. Can you assist this school district?

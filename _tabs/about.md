# Introduction

## Who am I?
I am ZL and I am in a graduate program for cybersecurity at Rowan University in my first year. This upcoming semester will be my second semester there. I am someone who is rather hardworking. I look forward to having you as the reader view this page per say. 

## Plans for this website
Due to this passion project that I have, it requires me to create CTFs in preparation for it. As such, periodically I will be uploading certain CTFs that I have created that are inspired by different CTF competitions that I have participated in. I find that you learn more about creating CTFs than actually doing them. This is due to the fact that you learn most of the concepts in a more hands-on approach by setting up the vulnerabilities which ultimate helps one gain a better perspective on things. It's sort of like one of those dungeon creator simulator games where you're a lich, and you have to set up the different walls and stuff of the dungeon.

Anyhow, I wish all of you a wonderful rest of your days or nights. See you soon!
Best Wishes,
ZL
